            allows students to understand the entire software development
            lifecycle, which is an essential skill in the real world.

            Capstone group projects allow students to gain practical experience
            working in teams to develop real-world applications. This experience
            helps them to develop soft skills like teamwork, communication, and
            problem-solving, which are critical in the industry.
